## Overview

Booked Up is the third project that we completed during our Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly. It is a MERN stack web application allowing book lovers to search through thousands of books, create their own library and discuss these books in virtual book clubs. 

This project was completed by a group of 3 and we were given just over a week to complete the project. At the beginning we knew that we really wanted to offer the user the ability of being able to communicate with other users and discuss books they have read or just have a general conversation about their love for reading. The most important aspect of the project that we wanted to get right was creating a journey for the user through the site and giving a quality UX. 

The books displayed to the user came from two external APIs, Google Books API and NY Times API. We would only store the books in the database that the user added to their library in order to improve performance.
